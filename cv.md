*Brief intruduction*
Hello! My name is Darya and I'm 38. During more than 15 years I'm working in the field of the intellectual property protection, being the trademark attorney from 2014. Some months ago I came to the conclusion that I want some changes in my professional life and as a result I start to study Frontend. Beginning from self-education by learning different books and tutorials, I have found the courses of RS School and I really understand that studying among like-minded people under mentoring of professionals in the field of Frontend - such way will give me great results.
